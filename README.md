# Setting up Tools for HTML/PDF Submission

Install **Python 3.8** in your distribution/OS. With
a suitable commandline, you could either run `pip` or
`python -m pip` as applicable. In many OSes, `python`
may be replaced with a call to `python3` and `pip` may
be replaced with a call to `pip3`.

```bash
pip install markdown python-markdown-mathjax md-mermaid pygmentize
```

Install **PhantomJS** and ensure it is in your distribution/OS.

I do not wish to claim that the answers are correct, in any way. They will
get updated, if I see they are wrong (or) someone helps me identify and hence fix
